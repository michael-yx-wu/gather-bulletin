# How this works

Glad you could make it! You've probably already figured out how to move around with the WASD and
arrow keys.

## Customizing your look

You can change your avatar and outfit by clicking on this button at the bottom of the screen:

## Public and private spaces

In a public space, you can see and hear everyone in a fairly wide radius. To have conversations with
a smaller group, move your group to a private space e.g. various tables, swing set, zen garden, etc.
While in a private space, the rest of the map will dim slightly.

## Rooftop

Walk up to the Christmas tree to go up to the rooftop! Once there, walk down the stairs to come back
inside the house.

## Games

There are some multiplayer games in the living room area (Tetris, draw battle, fishbowl). Poker is
on the patio out back. To play, walk over and press `x`.

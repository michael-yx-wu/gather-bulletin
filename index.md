## How this works

Glad you could make it! You've probably already figured out how to move around with the WASD and
arrow keys.

- **Customizing your look** &mdash; You can change your avatar and outfit by clicking on this button at the bottom of the screen:

- **Public and private spaces** &mdash; In a public space, you can see and hear everyone in a fairly
  wide radius. To have conversations with a smaller group, move your group to a private space e.g.
  various tables, swing set, zen garden, etc. While in a private space, the rest of the map will dim
  slightly.

- **Rooftop** &mdash; Walk up to the Christmas tree to go up to the rooftop! Once there, walk down
  the stairs to come back inside the house.

- **Games** &mdash; There are some multiplayer games in the living room area (Tetris, draw battle,
  fishbowl). Poker is on the patio out back. To play, walk over and press `x`.

- **PLTR ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€** &mdash; There's a fun video playing on the living room TV.
